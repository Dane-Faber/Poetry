    Many times I prayed and petitioned
    I asked you to talk to me
    I layed outside in the abyss of the night
    longing for a sign you hear my plea

    I can hear you when the rain plays
    Its sorrowful tune but dances
    With a glimmer of hope
    Against the pavement

    I can see you as the birds sing
    A chorus from their bare homes
    Of branches and bark

    I can feel you as the fall wind
    Caresses my face and says hello
    With an ever so familiar warmth

    I can feel you as I lay in the garden
    Under the sun
    The serenity and beauty surrounds me
    The grass under my body reminds me where I came from

    I discovered you in the embers of the fire surrounded by the pines
    in the tranquility of the water flow
    in elegancy of the changing leaves
    On the edge of the glassy trees

    I will always find you in the beauty of nature
    And that is enough for me

    When your silent nights become sleepless,
    From the deafening screams of duress and dread.
    When your sunny days are sullen
    From qualms queries and concerns
    About the life you live
    And the world you will leave.


    When your mind can no longer run
    And there is nothing left to numb
    And the blissful ignorance has finally succumbed
    To the one thing that remains:

    THE TRUTH

    The truth that we kill more than we create
    The truth that despite our clamor we have no answers
    The truth that it is easier to hurt than to help
    The truth that behind it all,
    The things we buy, the jobs we work, the gods we praise,
    It is hard to say if anything truly matters.


    But it is in this shadow of wretched honesty,
    When you feel most tempest-tost,
    When life feels most naked,
    That you can most clearly see Her beauty,
    And hear Her beckoning.

    It is the peace that washes over you
    During an unexpected sunset shared with a friend.
    It is the first time you see a green sprout
    As Spring begins and the cold monochrome of winter recedes.


    It is the elegance of an egret taking flight
    And the warmth of golden sun flickering through treetops
    It is in these faint and fleeting moments
    When Mother Nature lets Her truth be known.


    The truth that all life is sacred
    The truth that to heal nature is to heal yourself
    The truth that meaning is found in these moments
    Of beauty, gratitude, connection, and love.
    The truth that all that all that matters
    Is that anything matters at all.

    More than I do at points in time.

    That the trees rustle hello and goodbye with the wind,

    everchanging their appearance, morphing withthe change of seasons

    The trees along the lakeshore path share their comforting, safe energy.

    Miles and miles of continuous empty land.

    and the white pine trees.
    A kind of peace and happiness that one cannot monetize.
    I enter the freshwater spring, which, indeed, is a mirror of
    heaven.
    I look through the crystal-clear teal water and notice another dimension of life
    beneath me.
    Trout in every shape and size float through the spring’s forty-foot depth,
    continuing their graceful path.
    I wonder if they notice me.

    Deer come in all different shapes and sizes.
    White Tail, Mule, Reindeer, Roe, these deer all come and go.
    Light Brown fur, Black tipped nose, tail as white as snow. Bucks and doe’s alike roam the woods, fields, and grasslands.
    The bucks roam with a trophy placed upon their head, or at least as many see it.
    A thundering boom rolls across the field, the woods, and throughout homes.
    Thud, a heavy desperate drop.
    The trophy is removed and paraded around the neighborhood and mounted on walls,
    gone forever.
    These deer do the same to us as we do to them, they injure and even kill the ones we love.
    Is it the pure bliss of exploring the sounds your tender white ears are graced upon?
    Is it the curiosity of what the loud noise is accompanied by the bright shining light that inverts the dark of the night sky?
    You know the consequences
    You have seen firsthand what happens.
    Smack, thud, crash, crunch, they don’t come back,
    gone forever.
    Yet, you linger in the ditch.
    You know to run from humans when you see them within the timber-lined forest. They come into your abode with weapons and you leave faster than the blink of an eye, gone forever.
    Such intelligence, awareness, and lust for survival should be awarded.
    Yet you choose to be a fool.
    You meet at the top of the peak,
    your family watching behind you
    the human hurdling towards you in their multi-ton metal box.
    You lose your impeccable sense of survival as it is taken over by curiosity and you too are now,
    gone forever.

    She made the jewels belayed upon our royalty
    A holy mother, in her arms we laugh and cry
    But she loves all, more children than the eye can see
    No favor does she show, in her Grace we all lie

    Her plate is plentiful, what is there not to take
    An apple or the tree itself there still lies more
    Her hair is pinched and pulled, with eyes welled up like lakes
    Her beauty disappears, no longer we adore

    But still our mother stands against the hands of time
    And when our bodies join the ones that came before
    Her hair becomes renewed, with heart and soul sublime
    Our hunger gone, we can not hurt her anymore

    But in this time, a fraction of what hers could be
    Why can’t we live, enjoy what life was meant to be

    I didn’t know it was Thursday
    until a pair of round black crumbs
    fixed underneath my front porch
    illuminated by the moon’s flash
    sent the air beneath my feet
    and a booming hiss out of my mouth
    For nothing could be more abominable
    than the powdered-face creature
    at my feet with its front paws cradling
    a hollow seltzer can
    Truly detestable how a salt and pepper furred marsupial–
    who I cannot name--
    enroached their piggish nose on our property
    whispering a “welcome home” between their whiskers
    while gently nodding to how I had forgotten
    to lug the waste collection bins out to the street
    that morning.

    It’s a possum. It’s a possum. It’s a possum.
    My friend’s voice drowns my ears
    How could I be 22 years old
    and have never seen a possum?
    It’s a possum. It’s a possum. It’s a possum.
    I lay face-frozen on the sidewalk
    on my pouched stomach
    fingers and toes stretched out
    eyes closed,
    mouth still slight
    The possum glows
    beneath the darkness
    of my doorstep
    and tastes the sweet
    bubbling waters
    of hard lemonade
    How are we going to play?

    You’re more bogged-down than you wanted
    Sun too confident, air too thick
    Thankfully contained, concrete canopies
    Restrict but allow this escape.
    Cutting through the glare were their calls
    A delightfully suffocating extroversion
    More than you’ve met in a city like this

    They’re who you came to see
    You wish you knew more, you saw
    What that could look like—he was surrounded
    Soon lost count as he calmed their needing beaks &
    Gushed over how quickly they’d grown
    Clearly in coveted company
    But how long was he waiting for you
    to ask, to tell?

    You don’t mind the commotion
    Let them in,
    Single one out, perplexed as its purple streaks
    Past your pocket of solitude
    I was in that same spot before
    Same slightly uncomfortable seating position,
    Same slightly stained jeans, but
    You see slightly more

    Watching the ripples with just a touch more care
    You could stare for weeks
    Taking inventory of the branches, every
    Stone out of place; each leaf stolen
    As the flicker starts to dim
    You prefer it like this.
    You seem better equipped than I
    To turn this landscape into lessons
    Someone else has already learned

    I.
    “I know I’ll always think of you with something like hurt and nostalgia,”
    Was the tagline of my youth. How can I ever let go of my mom’s peonies? my neighbor’s dog. This
    summer’s especially green grass. My own sacred birch leaf.

    Or
    an “adjustment disorder,” the 2008 pediatrician told my mother, “she just has a hard time letting go.”
    So
    if girlhood is the story of desire, why am I drowning in it?

    I’ve been busy saying goodbye to everything.
    I think I’ve always been drawn to quieter things - quieter people, quieter places. but this fall, it felt like a
    dangerous time to be quiet.

    I wouldn't say I'm sad for no reason,
    but rather because the trees in my childhood backyard didn't look as healthy this year and I wasn’t able to
    get anything done in the meantime.

    The snow’s fall was not one of grace this December: it was messy, haphazard, wet. Not the kind of
    randomness one finds beauty in, and certainly not someone like me.

    II.
    It’s March now. I'm dancing in my room and the window is open and I'm happy that spring has come a bit
    earlier this year, yet I know its consequences. I decide I can think about that later.

    And now I simply let myself be sad.

    Prozac packs my feelings in clouds I can peruse. I've perfected the art of not flinching when I hear of a
    forest fire and no longer get a lump in my throat when I think about the arctic. I walk to class and stop in a garden I used to tell myself I didn’t have time to walk through.

    I haven’t named this feeling yet, numbness or tranquility. Accepting fall means welcoming the presence
    of winter.
    A letter from my mom with her pressed flowers is on the counter,
    and I think it’s okay to accept that maybe change leads to splendor, the coming of new beautiful, small
    things.

    I no longer think it’s an ugly road to adulthood.
    I have the seasons and oranges to share and mountains to see and gardens to seed.

    i was looking for a way to end my life
    in the trees that wept over changing
    like i did once. so i aimed earth’s weapon—
    a rock pointed like a dull blade to the sky
    drawing blood from veins in the trees toward the empty
    like i might survive its victory.

    and we saw a sign that willed us not to climb
    the rock that cut through the flesh of forest
    to make an open wound
    on my decomposing heart.
    one designed for lifting you and me
    to the afterlife, maybe

    like God, but a generic version
    this stoic stick figure on the warning sign
    demonstrated how to die and
    how to commit living
    like it’s not a crime.
    there the body of nobody rested
    below the rocks
    reduced to lines unnatural
    under a heaven i knew
    i wasn’t meant for.

    i was fated for falling, maybe
    from the highest point in the wood
    to land beside November and the dead leaves
    becoming the ground that offers my body—
    if it even matters,
    back to the sky.

    so i balanced an ending on the edge with you
    where all things become one single thing
    and where heaven and hell
    consume one another
    and nothing is determined
    not even living or dying, but maybe

    it had hurt not to climb
    until i started to
    and i’d not been climbing for so long
    that in searching for a way to end my life
    so far from where i’d been
    above a decaying canopy
    beneath a barren sky
    inside a dying body
    there with you
    instead i found a way to begin.

    Why are weeds considered undesirable?
    Must their existence be scorned?
    Sometimes I think if I were born
    as a ball of weed,
    that would have been better.
    I may not look as beautiful as those flowers,
    but at least no one will put me in a vase only
    for me to eventually
    wither away. Transient.
    Even if boots crush me in heavy weight,
    even if I am bent and mangled,
    even if the hands of a gardener pluck me
    away until I inevitably grow back,
    I will survive,
    and persist,
    and look up at the starry sky,
    and feel the soft winds,
    and drink the fresh rain water,
    and see everything the world has to offer,
    as much as I could possibly want.
    If that was so, wouldn’t my determination and will be
    admirable? The life of a weed is not so bad.
    No need to pay me any mind. No need to be
    beautiful
    or desired.
    Just let me exist as this precious weed
    to see the world in this way forever.

    <b>
    I travel to Cherokee Marsh at least once a week
    seeking solitude and eager to check in on a close friend.
    At the end of one of the trails on the Yahara River,
    just passed an ancient conical mound,
    lives an enormous willow tree.
    I am no arborist by any stretch of the imagination,
    but I would guess that the willow is a multicentenarian.
    I silently greet the willow with a gaze upon arrival
    and gently squeeze the deep grooves of the course bark with my hands.
    Some days I sit or stand at the base of the willow
    and other days I climb up to a perch, perfect for sitting.
    Either way, the mission is always the same-
    to simply be with an old friend,
    to ponder our existence,
    all while taking in the world around us.

    If movement is life,

    Is life.

    If movement is life,

    And the gentle breaths scattered by the occasional mutter as you sleep next to me

    And the change of your lips as you tell me about your day

    And my hand, scratching across this page of paper

    And the invisible wind blowing through the trees and forming ripples on the lake

    And the careful underground inching of roots in the soil

    And this planet, its continents ever shifting, shaping mountains and rivers and canyons and valleys

    And a sigh, for a finished day, for a melon and purplish-blue sunset, for a warm drink, for a sit on the couch, for a look in your eyes
    Is life.

    Metal tabs of next door’s Natty Lights tempt gulls and
    Plastic bags, pennies, and bottle caps the fish and
    Bic pens and hairties and styrofoam bits and
    Hot dog foil and a white plastic fork and

    Other unidentifiable and

    Yet when I drink my coffee,
    Looking out at this same water,
    Rolling stained glass curtains veil
    Weathered rocks bathing silent in this
    Chilled early December haze, lapping slow,
    Steady rhythm as if to say I’m here regardless.
    Two ducks float behind the branches of the willow,
    Sleeping naked as icicles cling to join her and the water
    While another paddling of mallards glide along the horizon
    While the mist cradles the forest edge
    While a humble reflection wavers on the still, slate water
    While the squirrels rustle, the songbird sings,
    And the waste management truck beeps.

    Walking up frat row littered with
    Seltzer cans and shattered Corona bottles
    A kaleidoscope of white butterflies frolic among
    The hopeless detritus of puke and pizza crusts.
    This is the grace of the world, wild things
    Turning our obscenity into beauty.
    Both can be true of the world.
    Both are true.

    It started with humanity’s need for industry.
    Synthetics flowed from factories,
    more smoke filled our skies
    than products filled our shelves.

    It continued with the lightbulb,
    where Edison took away our nights of sleep.
    His invention flooded our cities with a constant hue
    and clouded our skies with a glow visible for miles.

    I walk through darkness in the night,
    no outlines to see all the forest holds.
    Only those who are blessed,
    removed from the smog of civilization,
    removed from the glare of metropolis,
    may observe what I hold most dear.

    Only in complete darkness
    will the shadows distinguish themselves.
    For the moon is high and bright,
    its light separates trees from the forest’s depth.
    Moon shadows are not what they were,
    but cherish as they will never again be as they are.

    Have you ever heard of the knoll?
    It’s a place where you can go
    When you are full of woe
    To take a look around, above and below

    Underneath your feet, fungi speak
    And all around, sugar maples, red oaks and shagbark hickories creak
    There is no more impending doom
    Instead, wildflowers and native plants bloom

    When all else is wrong
    The Knoll is there to keep you strong.

    Mom’s flower beds are her life’s work.
    Always seasonal and inviting. The first
    thing you will notice when approaching
    our home is that there is life here.

    When my mom is not mom-ing,
    she is gardening. She learned to
    do so from her mother, who had to
    re-learn to love the earth from her mother.

    And this is because earth used to mean work
    and sweat and blood, but not in the good way
    my Mom claims as she dirties her hands for the
    tenth time this season.

    This way means something along the lines of healing.

    I know this, because each plant she houses is named
    after a thing she loves:

    The faces of our monarchs. A thesaurus’ worth of names
    for the color green. My brothers. Me.

    I know these things admire her back. Thank her
    for their homes by growing to spell her name,
    the flowers write Lucia and even the trees
    in the neighbors’ yards bow before it
    in branch-dropping awe.

    When Mom says she loves to watch me grow,
    I am unsure if she means this me or the plant me.
    I think that is comforting.

    As in, on the days my leaves are stagnant
    I adopt yet another plant for my windowsill,
    name it a part of my body, and it grows because
    I choose to let it.

    The 6 inches of a succulent
    survives a Madison winter
    and comes out the other side
    spelling my name too.

    Let us not forget this world was once not ours!
    Let us not forget the leaves unlit by fluorescence,
    Nor forget the Redwood as the tallest spire,
    Nor the commute from den to water.

    Let us not forget the music not of boxes blaring, but of birds, and rain, and grass, and wind,
    Let us not forget the buzz of bees and beetles, blithesome as it is,
    Nor forget the harvesting cranes, the mallards among the wild rice, the deer in gourds and grasses,
    Nor the flowers with dark red heart-shaped leaves.

    And us! What racket our sounds must be to them!
    But we are here! And, returning to the fields and forests, the mountain and the mollusks—play on!
    We do not defy your chants but instead we receive them, and repeat them,
    Tonguing them and turning them around ourselves, touching them to ourselves and to our ears,
    Dancing about them, and singing them.

    This is to sing, to revel, to turn in the dawdling day,
    To make merry in the shower of the birds’ supple song,
    To sonder among the shoots and the springs, forgetting you beget us, thrust us forth into an unending field, shot out between those yellow-golden shafts which bend to our coming.
    Surely, this was not made for us!
    Or, I suspect, it was; I suspect, it is.

    Let us not forget that into which we are born, and from which we shall part,
    But let us forget our creeds and our conscience as we pass, and bind ourselves to the dirt, and dance,
    And exhale our final whispers, and send forth puffs of grass, and deep burgundy drops of rain, and gasp,
    And remember what a lucky thing it is to look, and to admire!

    A pink magnolia only a little bit older than dad
    so small that it fit in the trunk of a car a mothers day
    gift grandma gave to herself bought from the nursery, she would say.
    I would hear the story once a year around the trees birthday
    she would come over and and admire the bullet shaped buds
    opening to reveal a white tipped flower destined to become pink

    Now it towers over the house, the driveway, the lawn, the sidewalk
    The once small sapling has different, thick trunks jutting up,
    sideways, left, right, some crooked, some straight, they
    span the width of the brown patterned brick below it.
    Its limbs have become hollow moss covered tubes,
    a knot has rotted out and has become a birds summer home
    cicadas crawl around it every summer leaving their molten shells
    behind which fall into the prehistoric hostas that circle the base of the trunk.

    It still blooms once every spring but, just as soon, as it blooms a storm comes
    knocking the sweet smelling flowers to the ground causing them to turn brown.
    Just as grandma would tell the same story almost every year
    dad tells me storm after storm that the tree as old as him needs to be cut down
    before it is too late before it falls before it hurts us or someone.
    Before its hollow limbs are snapped by the wind and destroy the house
    he has called home for his whole life just like the pink magnolia
    who has known nothing but my house its whole life

    A small tree
    An organism learning life
    Surrounded by other emerging existences
    None guaranteed a long moment
    Each longing for luminescence in any form possible
    Communicating in veiled words
    Unbeknownst to others
    Unbeknownst to themselves
    Their time is transient
    A blessing as well as any other

    Baptism of the Little Mermaid
    by Salome Sookoo

    One hand in my hair, one hand on my back
    As my body is lowered into the water.

    My mother comes home tired from work
    And sleeps on the other side of the bed

    The air suffocates with words
    God is always with you
    plugging my nose when I refuse to open my mouth.

    Yet I don’t turn into seafoam.

    And I slide around her on the tile
    Careful not to run over.

    Mothers are supposed to love you
    But the water stays warm longer

    And when my body is enveloped, I begin to breathe.
    If one tail is restricting, just ask for two.

    The sky is my open window at dawn
    The lake my steaming cup of tea,
    Glitchy glass singed from auburn clouds of matted snow
    A compact mirror taking reflection into its own interpretation,
    Currents circle in ceramic,
    Whirlpooling like hawks in autumn
    A murmuration in fewer numbers,
    The ellipses at the end of a sentence
    Orbitting each other like electrons, like solar systems,
    Like summer gnats who doodle lines
    In the blank canvas two feet above my head
    Mapping their intricate dance routine.
    I try to follow in wavering steps,
    Moving like hair through static air,
    Or tesla’s coil in cursive, in a game of underwater hopscotch,
    That I play as if I’m still a child,
    When I climbed ancestors with their calloused, mossy open arms.
    In an attempt to reach the height of noon,
    Only reaching the canopy crown, that kissed me in glowing splotches
    Spreading against translucent shadows of green.
    I listened to leaves hissing, birds whistling, gossiping their ancient wisdom
    Lecturing me of the unknown in promises of someday,
    Being revealed in the soil that will reclaim me
    Where their roots can wrap my hands in solidarity
    The way my small palms grab twigs to climb.
    As above, so below, middle ground the one I traverse.
    Wishing to plant my feet in the last box of hopscotch, I launch myself from the oak
    As I would a rubber swing in its high arch, its weightless chains
    Into the waltz of white pixies, the hazy snowglobe of now.
    Wind swathing my soul, twirling me in the air like a lifted ballerina
    A trust fall but forwards
    Where I drop, hands in the hollywood cement of my second mattress
    Forgetting the brute of breeze
    Who lashes and pummels against me,
    For not getting the steps right, for making a game out of a purposeful plan
    Whispering to me in stinging cheeks and numb fingertips
    Telling me to look up, look up, listen, watch.
    In piercing eyedrops, flicks of cold rain
    In choirs of song sparrows that almost hit me as they pass
    In wind that enters my lungs without permission,
    Breathing for me frantically, flushing into my nostrils
    Until I’ve forgotten how I’ve always done it.
    A call to wake, a branch bashing on the window during a storm
    A fist pounding on the wooden bedroom door.
    But the exhaustion wins and sleep comes and goes
    As sneakily as dreams in foggy memory, and darkness when the switch is flipped.
    The sunrise pools her honey at the start of the new day,
    The branch becomes an arm outstretched, an offering
    Of hot cinnamon tea waiting on the sill
    Basking in the grace of forgiveness and warm sunlight
    Letting me try again


    In accidental eyedrops, flicks of cold rain
    In flurries of birds that almost hit me as they pass
    In wind that enters my lungs without permission,
    Breathing for me frantically, flushing into my nostrils
    Until I’ve forgotten how I’ve always done it
    A call to wake, a branch bashing on the window during a storm
    Waving back and forth like the pendulum of a grandfather clock
    Hypnotizing waves back and forth, back and forth
    Like the pocket watch, my compact mirror
    Yet, when the sunrise pools her honey at the start of the new day,
    The branch becomes an arm outstretched, an offering
    Of hot chamomile tea waiting on the sill
    Basking in the grace of forgiveness and warm sunlight
    Letting me try again

    I want the wind to twirl me in the air like a lifted ballerina
    Trust fall but forwards

    I wave and move side to side
    Through the static air like hair
    Like tesla’s coil in cursive
    To remember what it was like to outstretch mossy arms
    Waving my fingernails like Im casting a spell
    I crave being tall, I lean to the light
    It reminds me of the tree at the top of the canopy
    I am the tree, the leaves shaking in the freezer aisle air
    I am michaelangelos finger, reaching and pointing to purpose

    Hellos & goodbyes & mountains & moons & midnight suns and too many moments
    Caribou trails leading the way, leading through willow brush and squishy tussocks
    Nalgenes of water pulled straight from rushing rivers coming straight from glaciers
    Identifying wildflowers, wondering what wildflowers are left to be identified
    Brown bears and blueberries, quite a duo, one you want from afar and one you want up close
    Light rain, heavy hail, hazy skies, snow, and an ever constant and prevailing sun
    A rhythmic swoosh of hiking poles and sore shoulders and achy legs

    Taking the time to avoid every other millionth mosquito
    Taking the time to fall in love with every peak, river braid, boulder, grizzly bear, and bear root
    Wanting enough time to fall in love with everything

    But time gave away to fall; wet boots turned frost covered
    45 unmarked homes in the Arctic Tundra to be left for the next
    Returning to the tall pines and kettle lakes of the Northwoods and regaining my fear of the dark

    Goodbyes & hellos & mountains & moons & midnight suns and too many memories to count

    Unsure if I betrayed the gardener
    Each time you thanked me,
    With an inspiring salute
    Farewell, or more likely,
    See you again
    It was pure curiosity
    You already knew me
    You were prepared
    Evaporating into the breeze
    Resting on the grass
    That same salute relieving
    The morning dew of their duties,
    Well,
    Thank you
    For letting me play
    I am happy to say
    That I helped
    A friend today
    And for my thanks,

    Would you do it again?
    Take the apple from the tree – Or maybe it was a peach –
    and feel far more than the sting of the bee.
    What will become of freedom?
    Merely tedium in the shadow of barren branches below winter sun

    Would you feel it again?
    All for your efforts to be in vain
    struggling to grow with strong enough grain
    to lend your heart to the current, the trees, the sun
    all the same sans shame.

    Would you build and become and break and begin
    – The world you call home doesn’t have much left to eek out of
    the ocean – Aphrodite came and under it
    so too will we go when the land of languishing ice leaks.

    It doesn’t matter if you’d choose the refrain.
    The course is already set, a sanguine strawberry stain
    from the vine in Grandmother’s Garden.
    Only the future is left in front of us;
    an indefinite plane
